## Real-Time Code Flow

1. **Initialization**:
   - JiffyCam object is created
   - Configuration is loaded
   - Circular buffer is initialized
   - Status flags are set to initial values

2. **Starting the System**:
   - `start()` method is called
   - Sets `_running` flag to True
   - Initializes and starts the camera, writer, and watchdog threads

3. **Camera Thread Flow**:
   - Continuously captures frames from the camera
   - Checks `_running` and `_paused` flags to determine operation
   - Adds timestamps to frames
   - Stores frames in the circular buffer
   - Updates frame counters and statistics

4. **Recording Trigger**:
   - When recording is triggered (either manually or by event):
     - `_recording` flag is set to True
     - Frames from the buffer (including pre-trigger frames) are marked for saving

5. **Writer Thread Flow**:
   - Monitors the clip queue for frames to be saved
   - When clips are available:
     - Sets `_saving` flag to True
     - Creates output file and writes frames
     - Updates statistics
     - Sets `_saving` flag to False when complete

6. **Watchdog Thread Flow**:
   - Periodically checks system health:
     - Camera thread responsiveness
     - Writer thread responsiveness
     - Disk space availability
   - Updates `_watchdog_ok` flag based on health checks
   - Can trigger system shutdown if critical issues are detected

7. **Shutdown Process**:
   - `stop()` method is called
   - Sets `_running` flag to False
   - Waits for threads to complete their work
   - Releases resources (camera, files)
   - Finalizes any pending operations

## Thread Synchronization

The code uses various synchronization mechanisms:
- Thread locks to protect shared resources
- Event objects to signal between threads
- Queue structures for thread-safe data passing
## Error Handling

The system includes error handling mechanisms:
- Try/except blocks to catch and log exceptions
- The watchdog thread to detect and respond to system issues
- Graceful degradation when resources are constrained

This architecture allows JiffyCam to capture video continuously while maintaining a buffer of recent footage, and quickly save clips when triggered, all while monitoring system health.

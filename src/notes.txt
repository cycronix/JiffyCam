bug:  after changing dates via calendar, then clicking 'Live' doesnt change to current date.  
        (this works with arrow-date changes?) 
        STILL THERE

frame_queue is useless in jiffycapture.py:  
    only value is current_fps snapshot.  
    width/height is no value (get from image if want): remove from status


Done/Old:

transitions from Live<->playback does double image flash?  
    e.g Live->Live seems to do a prev-step then RT
    FIXED

fast-reverse runs off back of FrontYard into BackYard data???
    this may fix?:  streamlit run jiffycam.py --server.headless true
    still happens on ipad.  timing/buffering issue?  cache-bust url?
    FIXED 

add heartbeat-save:
    save_interval -> heartbeat save (0 = off)
    new detect_interval -> renamed save_interval (0 = off)
    display_interval ???? (or just go asap )
    DONE

at start of new capture, can't view Live data unless something already saved...
    ~DONE.  less likely with auto-save save_interval

status info disabled, what is there is messy
    Needs tune up at least

todo:  update timeline with new saves in RT
    DONE

idea:   timeline bar dual mode:  if(Live): non-clickable, dynamic update; else: clickable, static update;
    build_main_area:  make one form or the other based on RT.  
    ui_loop:  update timeline if Live (dynamic enabled)
    DONE
